Welcome to My Flutter App!
Introduction

Welcome to my Flutter app, a cross-platform mobile application built with Dart. This app provides a modern and intuitive user interface, allowing you to interact with data fetched from an API and perform various tasks seamlessly.
Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the app on your local machine:

    Adjust the API File: Customize the API file (api.dart) to suit your specific needs. Update the endpoints, request parameters, and response handling according to your API requirements.

    Start the API: Ensure that your API server is up and running. You can start the API by running the appropriate command, such as python app.py or npm start, depending on your backend setup.

    Update API URL: In your Flutter app, navigate to the relevant file (e.g., Tool_Overview.dart) and locate the code block responsible for fetching data from the API. Update the URL to point to your API endpoint. For example:

    dart

    Future fetchData() async {
        final response = await http.get(
            Uri.parse('http://your_api_url/api/endpoint'),
            headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        );
    }

    Fetch Dependencies: Run flutter pub get in your terminal to fetch all the necessary dependencies specified in your pubspec.yaml file. This ensures that your project has all the required packages to run successfully.

    Run the App: Launch your Flutter app by running flutter run in your terminal. This command will build your app and deploy it to the connected device or simulator/emulator.

Usage

Once your Flutter app is up and running, you can explore its features and functionalities. Interact with the user interface, navigate between screens, and observe how data is fetched from your API and displayed within the app.
